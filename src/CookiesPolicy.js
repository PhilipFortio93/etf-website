                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Token Blocks takes your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy has been prepared in line with the EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which took effect on 25 May 2018. The GDPR promotes fairness and transparency for all individuals in respect of their personal data.</p>

                <p>This privacy policy applies to all data we process. Token Blocks powers dynamic privacy policies - so whenever we request data from you that requires your consent, we will ask for it explicitly. To enable this, we make a record of your consent (or otherwise) to the collection and use of such data whenever requested.</p>

                <p>If you would like to get in touch about anything in this policy or about your personal data then please contact us at privacy@tokenblocks.io</p>

                <h4>1.2. What data do we collect when you visit our website, and why?</h4>
                <p>We collect cookies. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites send to a user's computer and are stored on the user's web browser. They are designed to enable the website to remember information, such as what a user might have put in a shopping cart for example.</p>

                <p>For more information on our use of cookies you can view our cookie policy</p>

                <h2>2. What personal data do we share with third parties and who are they?</h2>
                <p>To power our services, we store or share personal data with the following third parties:</p>

                <ul>

                <p>We may transfer personal data to a country outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), for example if a third party we share data with has servers located outside of the EEA. If this is the case we will obtain your consent or otherwise ensure that the transfer is legal and your data is secure by following the EU's guidelines.</p>

                <p>You can see above where we send data outside of the EEA and on what basis we do so.</p>

                  <li>by encrypting personal data</li>
                  <li>by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology when information is submitted to us online</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the unlikely event of a criminal breach of our security we will inform the relevant regulatory body within 72 hours and, if your personal data were involved in the breach, we shall also inform you.</p>

                <h2>5. Changes to our privacy policy and control</h2>
                <p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will let you know by changing the date on this policy and notifying you of significant changes. By continuing to access or use our services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised privacy policy.</p>

                <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
